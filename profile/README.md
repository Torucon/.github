## Nice to meet you!

We are Torucon, an organization dedicated to organizing events for people interested in untraditional fiction and pop culture; comics, cartoons, manga and anime; sci-fi and fantasy novels, TV and film; trading card games, live action and tabletop roleplaying games, and all kinds of video games; non-western pop music, fashion and dancing; fanart, prop-making and cosplay; basically, all sorts of fantastical interests with few or no venues where people can take part in and share such experiences with other people.

That's a bit of a mouthful, but it's what we do! And everybody involved in making this happen is doing it with no monetary compensation. We're all volunteers, from the board members and leaders doing most of the planning and heavy lifting in advance, to the people working to bring it all to fruition during the event. We do it because we think the work is interesting, because we enjoy belonging to this community of volunteers that we have created over the past decade, and because we want the communities to which our attendees belong to thrive and prosper!
